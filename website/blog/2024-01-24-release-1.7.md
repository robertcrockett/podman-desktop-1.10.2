## Release Details

### Podman 4.9

ðŸ¦­ Podman 4.9 includes key fixes for stability and reliability issues reported by our users.
If you've been floundering we highly recommend updating!

If you are on a Mac M3, we are aware of a critical issue in Podman and expect to update very
soon to pick up this fix:
[#21353 - Update to new QEMU](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/21353) (based on
[#1990 - QEMU issue on M3](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1990)). If you are
hitting this problem there is a workaround [here](/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-podman-on-macos#on-apple-silicon-the-podman-machine-does-not-start) and [there](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/21088#issuecomment-1871502921).

### Extension API Improvements

We have spent a lot of time this release adding new extension API to give upcoming extensions
more capability and even better integration into ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop. We have added support
for full page webviews, image badges, icons, a navigation API, and API access to more function
from the container engine:

- Webview in the UI [#5594](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5594)
- Add webview API for extensions [#5592](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5592)
- Allow extensions to list webviews [#5628](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5628)
- Create container without starting it [#5643](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5643)
- Expose create/start Pod and replicatePodmanContainer [#5648](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5648)
- Expose create/list/delete volumes for extensions [#5598](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5598)
- Add getImageInspect to API [#5596](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5596)
- New contribution points for icon of image [#5543](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5543)
- Add BuildOption [#5533](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5533)
- Add platform parameter to image build method [#5501](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5501)
- Expose build image method [#5500](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5500)
- Navigation api [#5558](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5558)
- Register badges by extensions for image list/details [#5557](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5557)
- Install extensions from private registries [#5473](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/5473)

### Experimental Kubernetes UI

We have been working the last couple months to expand our support for Kubernetes. This support isn't ready
to set sail yet, but if you're working with a Kubernetes cluster we'd love to start getting your feedback
on the direction!

To 'break the seal' and try it out, go to Settings > Preferences > Kubernetes, and enable
the Experimental option:

![Kubernetes Preference](img/podman-desktop-release-1.7/kube-preference.png)

This will add three new items to the main navigation, allowing you to view
Deployments, Services, and Ingress & Routes:

![Kubernetes Deployments](img/podman-desktop-release-1.7/kube-deployments.png)
![Kubernetes Services](img/podman-desktop-release-1.7/kube-services.png)
![Kubernetes Ingresses & Routes](img/podman-desktop-release-1.7/kube-ingress-routes.png)

In this release you can click on deployments and services to view additional details (like the
Summary, Inspect, and YAML tabs), but not yet for ingresses or routes.

We hope things go swimmingly for you, but please open Github issues to let us know what else you'd like to see.

### Enhanced Builds, Pods List, and Troubleshooting Pages

When building an image you can now chose which platform(s) to build the image for:

![Build platform](img/podman-desktop-release-1.7/build-platform.png)

We've upgraded the Pods view to use the same table component as images and volumes. This
allowing sorting and better column scaling:

![Pods table](img/podman-desktop-release-1.7/pods-table.png)

Having trouble and want a fresh start? The Troubleshooting page has switched to tabs and there is an
option to purge your existing install:
