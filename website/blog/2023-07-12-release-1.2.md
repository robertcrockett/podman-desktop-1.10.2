## Release Details

### Added start/stop/delete/restart buttons for Compose

In the last month we've been addind support for more Compose features. Before you were only able to control a group of containers if they were in a Pod. Now we have added the ability to control a group of Compose containers. You can now start, stop, delete and restart a group of containers launched by either `docker-compose` or `podman-compose`.

Stay tuned as we add even more features to Compose! If you have any feedback or feature requests, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion on GitHub.

### Kubernetes context on the status bar

With Kubernetes context on the status bar, you can switch from one context to another in just a couple of clicks. Easily switch to a different cluster all together. If there are multiple contexts available, you can now click and pick which one to use.

### Protocol handler support

Podman Desktop now supports protocol handling when using the terminal! Want to access your favourite extension directly from a script or the terminal? If you type in `open podman-desktop:extension/redhat.openshift-local` in the terminal, Podman Desktop will automatically load up to the correct extension.
