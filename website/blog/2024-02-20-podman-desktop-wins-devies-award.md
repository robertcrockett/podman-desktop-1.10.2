We’re honored to announce that [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) has been recognized with the prestigious [**2024 DEVIES Award**](https://www.developerweek.com/awards/) in the category of **Containers & Kubernetes**. This award is a testimony to the effectiveness of the Podman Desktop team and greater open-source community's efforts to help developers. Podman Desktop increases developer container workflow efficiency as well as provides [an easy transition of applications from containers to Kubernetes](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/11/06/working-kubernetes-podman-desktop), the leading open-source container orchestration platform.
