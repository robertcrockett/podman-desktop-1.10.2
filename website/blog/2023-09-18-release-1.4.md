## Release Details

### Port range mapping [#3654](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3654)

When starting a new container, you can now map a port range between host and container. If the range is not valid between host and container, an error is raised.

### Terminal lifetime [#3725](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3725)

When a terminal is opened for a container, it can now be reused after you switched to another part of the Podman Desktop UI.

### Create volume [#3742](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3742)

The Volumes tab now has a Create volume button. The Create volume UI has a single field for the volume name.

### bash support [#3750](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3750)

When a terminal is opened for a container, if bash is available within the container, it will be used. Otherwise, sh will be used.
