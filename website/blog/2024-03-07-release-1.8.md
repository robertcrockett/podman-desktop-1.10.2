## Release Details

### Podman 4.9.3

ðŸ¦­ Podman 4.9.3 includes key fixes for stability and reliability issues reported by our users - especially
if you are using Apple silicon architecture. If you've been floundering we highly recommend updating!

### Kubernetes Explorer

Progressively introduced in past releases as an experimental feature, we're ready to expand
our capabilities to help developers transition from containers to Kubernetes. In this release we
are introducing a new set of features that enable the developers to work with more Kubernetes
resources, offering more granular and interactive control over your applications.

Now available in ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop is a new Kubernetes Explorer with the ability to work with
Deployments, Services, Ingresses, and Routes, in addition to the existing support for Pods.
For each of those resources, ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop provides real-time information about the status of
resources on the cluster. From the top right of this overview page you can also click Apply YAML
to create or update resources on the cluster similar to 'kubectl apply -f', and see the current
connection status.

![Deployments Overview](img/podman-desktop-release-1.8/deployments.png)

Just like with local containers or images, you can click for more
details on Summary, Inspect, and Kube (YAML) pages.

See a problem? You can edit and apply changes direct from the Kube tab.

ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop continues to bridge the gap and discrepancies to empower developers working
with containers with efficient workflows to target Kubernetes from their local workstation.
This is all in addition to some of the great features already available:

- Native Kubernetes support with Podman
- Podify - transition containers into Pods
- Setting up local Kubernetes environments with Minikube and Kind extensions
- Deploy to Kubernetes and push local image from Podman to a Kubernetes environments
- Managing Kubernetes contexts
- Connecting to remote Kubernetes clusters

### Global Onboarding

Configuring and setting up a local environment is now easier with the introduction of a new
wizard-based onboarding flow. In this flow developers can pick the different tools that they
need, and ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop will walk them through the configuration and setup of each of these
tools.

The global onboarding flow allows developers to configure Podman, Compose, and kubectl
(needed for working with Kind and Minikube or remote Kubernetes environments). This makes
the transition to ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop becomes simpler, as any needed dependencies are
automatically configured.

### Learning Center

In this release, we've added a Learning Center on the Dashboardm enabling developers to
discover, learn, and expand their knowledge on related topics to containerization. These
guides are handy and easily accessible, and cover topics from learning how to containerize
an existing application to discovering the latest features of ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop and how to
best use them.
