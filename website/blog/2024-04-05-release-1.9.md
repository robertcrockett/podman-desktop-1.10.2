## Release Details

### Podman v5 (5.0.1)

Podman version 5 is out! [see blog post introducing Podman v5](https://blog.podman.io/2024/03/podman-5-0-has-been-released/)

On macOS there are performance enhancements as Apple Hypervisor is used instead of QEMU for the Podman machine. Also expect better performance on the file sharing.

That said, Podman machine version 5 is introducing changes that are not compliant with podman machine version 4.

This is why we're rolling out Podman version 5 by default only to new users to improve the migration from Podman Desktop side.

For Podman version 4 users, Podman version 5 is accessible using an [experimental flag](#enabling-experimental-flag).

Moving to Podman v5 implies to optionally save images and then delete previous machines and create a new one.

#### Important steps before updating

Prioritize data backup by using the save feature in the `Image Lists` section. This feature allows you to back up your images and restore them once you have a new Podman machine.

When prompted to update, confirm to remove all existing data from your machines.

For more details on the save/load feature, refer to [the save/load images section of the release notes](#saveload-images-or-exportimport-containers).

#### Enabling experimental flag

Are you using Podman 4.x but eager to migrate? Enable the Podman `v5` experimental flag in `Settings > Preferences > Extension: Podman`.

This will make the Upgrade option available on the Dashboard.

#### Onboarding notification for Podman version 5

If you have previously installed Podman version 5 and Podman Desktop detects some invalid Podman machines, you'll see a notification on the dashboard to clean up old machines.

### Podman 4.9.4

If you want to stay on Podman v4.x, there is a new update for some bugs including a CVE/security issue.

### Save/Load Images or Export/Import Containers

Podman 5 is not able to read 4.x machines, so before updating you'll need to backup images that you need to keep. You don't need to backup images that are available on remote registries or transient.

#### Save/Load Images

ðŸ¦­ Use Podman Desktop to save images and load them again.

![Select images to save](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-save-1.png)

![Save images](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-save-2.png)

Load images using the Load button from the image list.

![Select images to load](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-load-1.png)

![Load images](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-load-2.png)

#### Save/Load Containers

ðŸ¦­ Export filesystem of containers and import them.

![Select containers to export](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-export-1.png)

![Export containers](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-export-2.png)

Import containers using the Load button from the image list.

![Select files to import](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-import-1.png)

![Import images](img/podman-desktop-release-1.9/podman-import-2.png)

**_NOTE:_** Exporting the filesystem of containers only exports the content of the filesystem. Importing will result in a container without any commands, so this might not be what you expect.
Please prioritize the usage of image saving/loading over container export/import.

### Terminal in Kubernetes Pods

In the previous release we introduced several new features in Kubernetes, but one notable addition was missing. With the 1.9 release, we're excited to announce that you can now connect to the terminal of a pod.

- Terminal Connectivity: Users can now establish a direct connection to the terminal of a pod, enhancing the management and troubleshooting capabilities within Kubernetes environments.
- Container Toggle: When a pod contains multiple containers, you can easily toggle between them to access the terminal of the desired container.

How to access to the Terminal:

Navigate to the pod details in Podman Desktop and select the "Terminal" Tab..

If the pod contains multiple containers, utilize the toggle feature to select the container whose terminal you wish to connect to.

Once connected, you can interact with the terminal to perform various tasks such as debugging, log monitoring, or executing commands within the container environment.

### Extension API Improvements

We continued spent a lot of time adding new extension API to give upcoming extensions
more capabilites and even better integration into ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop:

- feat: add navigateToAuthentication method to navigation API [6603](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6603)
- feat: add secrets handling to extensionContext in extension api [6423](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6423)
- feat: add sign in button for auth providers w/ the only auth session request [6446](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6446)
- feat: support for webview reveal [6546](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6546)

Also we published a test framework to test extensions in separate repositories

- feat: publish ui components and test component as part of the release [6580](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6580)
