- **Extension packs and extension dependencies**: Install group of extensions in one click
- **Resource details page update**: See summary and log for resource

## Release Details

### Compose group Logs tab [#3176](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3176)

When clicking on the group of containers, you can now view the logs of the entire group of compose containers and don't need to open
log for every component individually.

### Podman user-mode networking support to Windows/WSL [#3251](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3251)

Certain VPN setups or other specialized networking configs will block traffic from the virtual WSL networking device, resulting in the podman WSL backend from being unable to contact systems on the VPN, and potentially losing internet access altogether. The new switch allows you to create a podman VM machine configured to work correctly in mentioned above networking environments.
