# Using the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable

Consider using the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to migrate transparently from Docker to Podman Desktop on all platforms.

- Continue using familiar Docker commands.
- Take advantage of the benefits of Podman.
- Your tools, such as [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/), communicate with Podman without reconfiguration.

#### Prerequisites

- Podman

#### Procedure

 <Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
   <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

1. Identify the location of your Podman pipe

```shell-session
$ podman machine inspect --format '{{.ConnectionInfo.PodmanPipe.Path}}'
```

2. Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to your Podman pipe location. You'll need to replace back slashes with forward slashes and add the `npipe://` scheme to the path retrieved previously:

> Example:
>
> **prefix**podman-pipe
>
> **npipe://**//./pipe/podman-machine-default

Depending on your terminal emulator of preference there is a little variation between the commands to set a session level environment variable:

##### cmd - Command Prompt

```cmd
set DOCKER_HOST=npipe://<inspect_command_output>
```

##### Git Bash

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=npipe://<inspect_command_output>
```

##### Powershell

Don't miss the quotes on the value or powershell will try to interpret it as a separate command instead of a value.

```powershell
$env:DOCKER_HOST="npipe://<inspect_command_output>"
```

Ideally you should set `DOCKER_HOST` at the system or user level environment variables (or even load it in your CL emulator init script of choice)

Note: Setting the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable isn't necessary on Windows since Podman also listens to the default `docker_engine` pipe. But it may be necessary if you get the following error: **Error: socket of machine is not set** while trying to use the podman compose command.

<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

1. Identify the location of your Podman socket

```shell-session
$ podman machine inspect --format '{{.ConnectionInfo.PodmanSocket.Path}}'
```

2. Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to your Podman socket location. Be sure to add the `unix://` scheme to the path retrieved previously:

```shell-session
$ export DOCKER_HOST=unix://<your_podman_socket_location>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

1. Identify the location of your Podman socket

```shell-session
$ podman info --format '{{.Host.RemoteSocket.Path}}'
```

2. Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to your Podman socket location. Be sure to add the `unix://` scheme to the path retrieved previously:

```shell-session
$ export DOCKER_HOST=unix://<your_podman_socket_location>
```

   </TabItem>

 </Tabs>

#### Verification

- Your tools using the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable, such as [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/), communicate with Podman without reconfiguration.
