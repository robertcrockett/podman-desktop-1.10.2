// Function to safely "guess" if the image is actually a manifest
// IMPORTANT NOTE:
// This is because there is no clear way to now what a manifest
// is in the Dockerode API / Podman API (yet). This is a workaround
// until we have a better way to determine if an image is a manifest
// See issue: https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22184
//
// We will "safely" determine if an image is a manifest by checking:
// - VirtualSize is under 1MB, as the manifest is usually very small and only contains text
// - Labels is null or empty, as the manifest usually doesn't have any labels
// - RepoTags always exists, as the manifest has a tag associated
// - RepoDigests always exists as well, as the manifest has a digest associated
// - Connection type is "podman"
// - History is null or empty
// - Engine type is "podman"
// all of these conditions must be met to (safely) determine if the image is a manifest
//
// We will check this within ImageInfo
export function guessIsManifest(image: ImageInfo, connectionType: string): boolean {
  // There is an odd case that if the image has been renamed, we may not be able to safely detect
  // if it is a manifest or not.
  // ex. podman image tag testmanifest testmanifest123

  // This is a "hacky" way to do it, but we can check to see if the image has been renamed by anaylzing the digests
  // as they will be pointed
